# Gitcoin Enterprise

This project is inspired by [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co/).  
[gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co) improves Open Source & Peer To Peer collaboration.   

[gitcoin-enterprise.org](https://gitcoin-enterprise.org) improves Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration in the enterprise context which is sadly restricted by inventions like income taxes and other impediments which are slowing down global progress.  


## Motivation

To support the emergence of fluid Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration styles GitHub Enterprise offers only some of the features of gitcoin.co for the enterprise context.

GitHub Enterprise focuses on optimizing **Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration** within restricted and over- / disregulated systems (e.g. suffering from income tax and other penalties for creating value). 

## How it works

1. Someone who wants to delegate a task funds this task
2. Someone who solves this task receives the reward / funding aka. bounty

For legal simplification reasons Gitcoin Enterprise - for the time being - does not use a crypto currency / e.g. ERC20 token (which could easily be traded for "real" money) but just an enterprise-internal Gitcoin Enterprise Coin which is only meant to optimize **Peer To Peer Collaboration**. This should lower the legal barrier for improving at least **Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration**.
