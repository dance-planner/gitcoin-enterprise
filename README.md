# GitCoin Enterprise

This project is inspired by [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co/).  
[gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co) improves Open Source & Peer To Peer collaboration.

[gitcoin-enterprise.org](https://gitcoin-enterprise.org) improves Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration in the enterprise context which is sadly restricted by inventions like income taxes and other impediments which are slowing down global progress.

## How it works

1. Someone who wants to delegate a task funds this task
2. Someone who solves this task receives the reward / funding aka. bounty

For legal simplification GitCoin Enterprise - for the time being - can not use a crypto currency / e.g. ERC20 token (which could easily be traded for "real" money) but just an enterprise-internal Coin which is only meant to optimize **Peer To Peer Collaboration**. You can call it **Collaboration Token**.

A playground to explore the features can be found [here](https://gitcoin-enterprise.org).

## Background Info

To support the emergence of fluid Inner Source- & Peer To Peer collaboration styles GitCoin Enterprise offers only some of the features of gitcoin.co for the enterprise context.

GitCoin Enterprise focuses on optimizing **Inner Source & Peer To Peer collaboration** within restricted and disregulated systems suffering from income tax and other penalties for creating value.
