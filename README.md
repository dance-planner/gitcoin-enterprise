# Gitcoin Enterprise

This project is inspired by [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co/).  
gitcoin.co improves Open Source collaboration.  
gitcoin-enterprise improves Inner Source collaboration in the enterprise context which is sadly restricted by inventions like income taxes...  

## Motivation
To support the emergence of flat and fluid - peer to peer - collaboration styles we would like to offer some of the principles of gitcoin.co in the enterprise context. 

## How it works
For legal simplification reasons gitcoin-enterprise - for the time being - does not use a crypto currency / ERC20 token but just an internal gitcoin-enterprise GCE.  

## Status
Experimental
